## Your playground for cryptography, coding & data

ciphereditor is a web app for cryptography, coding and data encouraging beginners and pros alike to explore new operations and build own workflows – [ciphereditor.com](https://ciphereditor.com)

## How to navigate the source code

As a monorepo this repository contains multiple packages to share common dependencies or to depend on each other. All packages listed below share the same version.

- `app-web` - Core web app built on React and Redux Toolkit
- `app-desktop` - Desktop application source built on the web app and Electron
- `types` - TypeScript types shared between packages and third-party extensions
- `processor` - JavaScript sandbox for Browser environments where extensions are executed in
- `extension-essentials` - Extension providing essential operations
- `extension-hash` - Extension providing operations related to cryptographic hash functions

## Build your own

To build the project on your own machine you may [download a release](https://github.com/wierkstudio/ciphereditor/releases) or clone the entire repository using Git by issuing the command `git clone git@github.com:wierkstudio/ciphereditor.git` in your terminal.

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and use the same version as mentioned in `.nvmrc`. Install the dependencies by issuing `npm install` in your terminal within the repository root folder. You need to repeat this step every time `package-lock.json` changes.

Following commands are available in the repository root folder:

- `npm run lint` - Lint all projects
- `npm run app-web-build` - Create an optimized production build for the web app
- `npm run app-web-start` - Start the development server for the web app
- `npm run app-web-preview` - Locally preview the production build for the web app
- `npm run app-desktop-start` - Start the development Electron app locally
- `npm run processor-build` - Create an optimized production build for the processor
- `npm run processor-watch` - Watch the processor source files and build on change
- `npm run extension-essentials-build` - Create a production build for the essentials extension
- `npm run extension-essentials-watch` - Watch the essentials extension source files and build on change
- `npm run extension-hash-build` - Create a production build for the cryptographic hash function extension
